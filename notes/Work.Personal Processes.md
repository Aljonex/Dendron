# Pre Ticket/Project Checklist
- Picking up the task
    - Read through
    - Call/Meeting with seniors to talk it through
        - Maybe the BAs too
        - Discuss how to break it down in to subtasks
    - Re-evaluate the estimate
- Split the ticket in to smaller subtasks
    - More admin
    - Easier to estimate the smaller chunks
    - More touch points to step back and re-evaluate if the bulk of the work it on track or not
    - Code reviewed earlier
- Book meetings in the calendar to make sure there is time for help to be got
    - Don’t worry about how busy we are
- Need to work on the approach to tickets generally so the steps from this are applied to everything going forwards
- Don’t just challenge the estimate at the start, challenge the moment it is going wrong, don’t wait till the end of the estimate

# Post Ticket/Project Checklist
- Have you written tests in a way that there's 100% coverage
- Have you written tests in a way such that if someone picked up the work they'd understand it
- Have you scheduled a demo/asked for quality assurance approval?

# Picking up and testing
You probably want to take the perspective of if its not your work but you've been given the task of *amendment*/*refactoring* and you have no clue what it does, what would you want to see on testing side to be comfortable making changes.


# Debugging generally
- Have you used the inspector on the UI?
- Have you looked at relative code and used breakpoints to find out what's not working?
