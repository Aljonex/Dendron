## First tutorial
Mainly setup and a bit of reading on AWS services as the goal of the training is to create a simple microservice, and use a stripped-back version of the Integration Layer's event based architecture.

- CloudWatch
- CodeBuild
- S3
- AWS Systems Manager
- SNS

## Second tutorial
Began with some reading into TypeScript and things to note around how it works in VSCode, also some JavaScript gotchas, like *falsy* values. [Truthy vs Falsy](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-truthy-falsy/)
