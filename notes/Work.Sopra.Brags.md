# Pre 6-month probation
- Got my diploma for my MSc degree with a distinction
- Been offered to be help with the Recruitment process
- Created a training course for new trainees and spearheaded the project for training people on the basics of Argo
- Finished training in the time required and then immediately went into a team (8.47) before any of the other trainees (who'd begun before me)
- Completed lots of tickets around removal of jobs and authorities and custom code deletion
- Understanding more about platform issuer causing a bug in both `.388` and `.220` which then allowed me to increase my ability of skirting through code and then bringing relevant interface implementations across to another branch to test a bug

# 1 year pay review
- Completed resiliency testing with Gerald which involved trying to get to grips with Terraform and the `us-east-2` env for testing in Ohio, involved over 30 PRs and 3 days of work with Gerald and Max standing up new databases, eks workers and file systems, getting access to AWS to monitor changes and try and keep track of lots of moving parts, learned that sandbox-resources vs applications have main differences that the resources are pure yaml and the application files are `hamal` which are more helm specific. (Done from 29/05 to 02/06) | [ETPS-2470](https://jira.apak.com/browse/ETPS-2470) -> **40+ pull requests**
- Setup new cloud environment, called `sales-demo-test` for the sole purpose of testing, [ETPS-2474](https://jira.apak.com/browse/ETPS-2474), wrote 2 short confluence pages on it
- Helped with 3 interviews
- Core part of Fleet
- Leading standups
- Finish complex piece for the fleet project involving implementation of a new additional item which meant getting in and editing 35 files in the core system and making model changes, and trying to get this new cog into the monolith without causing errors so extensive testing was also required
- Following this completed a piece for addition of Upfront Invoices being output involving the addition of this to the system and model so that it could be used across HOB
- Started code reviewing to build up portfolio of 8.47 code reviews
- Hosted knowledge sharing session on Kibana with Arpit for Noida Devs and then 2 groups of BAs (CRM and someone else)

When coming into the meeting don't necessarily talk about goals but how I've progressed towards goals, i.e. have done X code reviews in preparation to submit my portfolio to be a signed off code reviewer, have completed Y interviews as a helper to help prepare to get signed off as a level 1 interviewer


### How to hit superior to expectations
- Pick up 2 or 3 extra curriculars
- Read Spring/springboot, hibernate, and underlying systems
- Look into reflection in Java and base of Java
